      "message": "Design question: You prefer this to having an entity group with separate keys for each of primary_url and auth_db_rev? Then there\u0027s no index for these two properties.\n\nWhen using this form you could use monotonically increasing numbers for the shards, so AuthReplicationState.shard_ids would become num_shards as a single integer, and the gets would become trivial since it\u0027d be a range(AuthReplicationState.num_shards).\n\nAnother value of this layout is that entities are going to be locally stored, which means that at least in theory reads are going to be faster.",
