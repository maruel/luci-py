      "message": "One of the drawback of doing it here is that if there\u0027s a CR on the previous page and LF on the next one, it won\u0027t be caught. I\u0027m ambivalent about this.\nAlso note this is a problem that the data is not chunked at utf-8 character boundary, but is really a byte stream.\n\nI think we can survive this until someone complains but I\u0027d recommend keeping a note in the code so if this is ever brought up, it\u0027s easier to find where to fix the bug.",
