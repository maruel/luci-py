      "message": "If you want to update chrome-infra-auth:\n1. Wait until the luci-py commit reaches chrome-infra-auth-dev in https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/infradata/gae (can take ~15 min since the commit).\n2. Since you are changing permission, once the commit is deployed to -dev, there\u0027ll be a flurry of activity in https://chrome-infra-auth-dev.appspot.com/auth/change_log (REALMS_GLOBALS_CHANGED and REALMS_REEVALUATED events). It means it picked up permission changes and propagated them. I believe it takes ~5 min.\n3. To deploy to prod make a CL similar to https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/infradata/gae/+/634beaf201cbbecf8e14ce2d97528400f870a33c \n4. Once again wait until https://chrome-infra-auth.appspot.com/auth/change_log has realms-related events. It means the change is propagated to prod now.",
