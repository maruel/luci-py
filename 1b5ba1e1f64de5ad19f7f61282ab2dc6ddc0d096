      "message": "FTR, I wasn\u0027t a fan of data.install_packages_fn() and had a local branch to get rid of it. Sadly I waited years to finish it and my local branch was beyond repair so I just deleted it. I note this because I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the best pattern:\n\n- This flow enforces full serialization. In practice it should be fine to install named caches, CIPD packages and isolated files concurrently.\n- These calls shouldn\u0027t a variable. It should just be a function.\n\nThat said, since the end goal is to get rid of the whole thing, this is fine for now and you can ignore my comment. I just wanted to note this because the Go code should try to be more efficient here.",
