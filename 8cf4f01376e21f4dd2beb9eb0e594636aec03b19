      "message": "This looks like a bug! (Unrelated to your change, but it has an impact)\nIt doesn\u0027t take in account the sum of the previous slice expiration_secs. :(\nIt mostly worked because in general we have 2 slices, one with one short expiration, the second with a large expiration.\n\nSee https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/infra/luci/appengine/swarming/server/task_request.py?l\u003d1150 for an example how the summary is done. It would look like:\n\n  expiration_secs \u003d sum(t.expiration_secs for xrange(slice_index+1))\n\nIf you could add a test that confirms that, it\u0027d be great. That said this can be fixed in a separate CL but that has implication in the code you just added.",
