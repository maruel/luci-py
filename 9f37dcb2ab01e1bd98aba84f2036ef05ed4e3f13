Is there a better way?\n\nAt the very least, this is inconsistent with Swarming:TokenServer interaction that does not import protos, but simply makes JSON requests:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/infra/infra/+/master:luci/appengine/swarming/server/service_accounts.py;l\u003d384;drc\u003d8761768ee83029ccefb8f59517afab54a0219edf\nRequests in go/resultdb-swarming are even simpler than TokenServer RPCs, so simple JSON is ought to work just fine?\n\n+Vadim in case he has better ideas",
