      "message": "For buildbucket, we used per dimension expiration value. I feel this is more useful for the user than having to understand task slices.\n\nIt\u0027s explained there:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/infra/go/src/go.chromium.org/luci/buildbucket/proto/config/project_config.proto?q\u003dproject_config.proto\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d312\n\nSo basically the idea would be for the user to provide --opt-dimension \u003ckey\u003e \u003cvalue\u003e \u003cexp\u003e\n\nand the script would construct the needed task slices accordingly. It\u0027s easier for the user.",
