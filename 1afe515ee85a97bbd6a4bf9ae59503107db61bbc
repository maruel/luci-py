      "message": "I mean in general, same data structure is needlessly represented differently in Buildbucket and Swarming protos.\n\n\u0027tags\u0027 is a better example. In Buildbucket tags are \"repeated StringPair tags\". Here they are \u0027map\u003cstring, Strings\u003e\u0027. FWIW, I prefer how Buildbucket does it. It is simpler to work with and more strict (we have an option to preserve order if we want to).",
