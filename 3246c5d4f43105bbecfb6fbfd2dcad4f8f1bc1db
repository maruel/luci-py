However, there\u0027s a `swarming.pool.version` tag on all tasks now (https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/task?id\u003d40b84e6d09402410\u0026refresh\u003d10\u0026request_detail\u003dtrue\u0026show_raw\u003d1), which would be enough to query for tasks which picked up a new config version.\n\nI could also add a new tag which is the (input) version of CIPD. Getting the resolved version (e.g. if the input version is a ref) would be a bit trickier (but too hard) if you think that\u0027s worthwhile.",
