      "message": "it is a bit weird to record current time in a time-series metric. The time is already a part of the schema.\n\nI believe a more idiomatic approach is to increment a counter. Then we can use Delta in mash to see how many imports happened between any two points of time, something that this schema will not allow",

Then once we\u0027re agreed on the right metrics, I can follow up with the implementation.",
