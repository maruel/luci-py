At least it will be easier to add poolViewer to poolUser later, if necessary, compared to removing it.\n\nNote that normally few *people* will have \"poolUser\" role. Normally most would schedule builds through Buildbucket and they won\u0027t need \"poolUser\" role for this (the buildbucket will have it though, via role/luci.internal.system). \n\npoolUser will be given to:\n  * LED users so they can schedule builds via LED bypassing Buildbucket.\n  * People who like to run isolated tests directly from their workstations (I\u0027m not sure how popular this is).",
