Also it\u0027s not guaranteed that powershell is correctly installed.\n\nget_audio() above is a good example. I think the following would work:\n\n  wbem \u003d _get_wmi_wbem()\n  if not wbem:\n    return None\n  # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/stormgmt/msft-physicaldisk\n  return sorted(set(\n    \u00271\u0027 if d.MediaType \u003d\u003d 4 else \u00270\u0027\n    for d in wbem.ExecQuery(\u0027SELECT * FROM MSFT_PhysicalDisk\u0027)\n  ))\n\nI think having the other get_ssd() functions returning a list is an error in hindsight but it\u0027s not worth fixing for now.",
