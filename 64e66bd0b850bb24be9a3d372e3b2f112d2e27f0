So task runner could specify it or not.\nSo you could specify it as the task request in the manifest, it doesn\u0027t need to be in the TaskProperties, it could just a server side toggle as a temporary hack that you return as a bool on pool.\n\nAs a matter of fact, instead of returning a bool, let\u0027s return the package name and version! This way every single task has a clear \"Which CIPD package to use as the isolated client\" which I think what we\u0027ll want on the long term for task_runner too.\n\nI don\u0027t have a strong stance; it\u0027s just that \"happens to be there\" is not really hermetic and reproducible and makes debugging behavior later harder.",
