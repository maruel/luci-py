      "message": "Note: \"Result\" makes it sound like this is only for finished tasks, although TaskResult seems to exist also for pending/running tasks as well (right?). Since the name TaskState is already used, calling this TaskStatus or something would just be confusing.\n\nSo, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s helpful to rename this (unless you can think of a better name), but the comment here could clarify that the task is not necessarily completed. Fields like completed_time and abandoned_time will be set to some special value (zero timestamp?) if it never completed or was abandoned.",
