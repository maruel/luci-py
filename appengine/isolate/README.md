# Isolate Server

An AppEngine service to efficiently cache large set of large files over the
internet with high level of duplication. The cache is content addressed and uses
[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) as its backing store.

Isolate enables sending _temporary_ files around. It is a pure cache, _files_
will be deleted.

Isolate can be used standalone when only files need to be transfered but no task
scheduler is needed.
