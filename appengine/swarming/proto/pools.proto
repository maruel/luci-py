// It defined a set of Pool objects, each one corresponding to a single Swarming
// pool dimension. Each Swarming task resided in some pool, and each Swarming
// bot belongs to at least one pool.
//
// Pools are used to isolate groups of tasks/bots from each other for security
// and capacity reasons. Two different pools should not interfere with each
// other at all (unless explicitly configured to share bots or accounts).

  // If 'true' and callers try to add a task that use a pool not defined in
  // 'pools' above, Swarming will reject the call with "Permission Denied"
  // error.
  //
  // If 'false', Swarming will allow the task if caller has 'can_create_task'
  // permission. This is used for backward compatibility with simple Swarming
  // deployments that don't do pool isolation.
  //
  // Note that tasks in undefined pools aren't allowed to use service accounts,
  // since Swarming doesn't know what accounts are allowed in such unconfigured
  // pools.

// X is a delegatee. When X calls Swarming, it makes an RPC to the token server
// to make a delegation token that says "<X can call Swarming on behalf of U>".
//
// This token is then sent to the Swarming with the RPC. Swarming sees that
// the direct peer it's talking to is X, but the call should be performed under
// the authority of U.
//
// We extend this to also allow X make authorization decisions about whether U
// can use particular Swarming resource or not. The result of this decision is
// encoded in the delegation token as a set of "key:value" tags. Swarming then
// can treat presence of such tags as a signal that the particular call is
// allowed.
