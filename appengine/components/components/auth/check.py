  This is intended to be called by request processing middlewares right after
  they have authenticated the peer, and before they dispatch the request to the
  actual handler.

  It checks IP whitelist, and delegation token, and updates the request auth
  context accordingly, populating peer_identity, peer_ip, current_identity and

  Args:
    ctx: instance of api.RequestCache to update.
    peer_identity: caller's identity.
    peer_ip: instance of ipaddr.IP.
    is_superuser: true if peer is authenticated as a superuser (e.g. GAE admin).
    delegation_token: the token from X-Delegation-Token-V1 header.
    use_bots_ip_whitelist: [DEPRECATED] if true, treat anonymous access from
