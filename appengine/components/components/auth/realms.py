def merge(permissions, realms, out=None):
  """Merges multiple realms_pb2.Realms into one, fills in `api_version`.

  The given list of permissions will become authoritative: if some realm uses
  a permission not in the list, it will be silently dropped from the bindings.
  This can potentially happen due to the asynchronous nature of realms config
  updates (e.g. a role change that deletes some permissions can be committed
  into the AuthDB before realms_pb2.Realms are reevaluated). Eventually the
  state should converge to be 100% consistent.

  Args:
    permissions: a sorted list of realms_pb2.Permission with all permissions.
    realms: a dict {project ID -> realms_pb2.Realms with its realms} to merge.
    out: a realms_pb2.Realms to write the result into (will not be cleared!).

  Returns:
    `out` or a new realms_pb2.Realms if out was None.
