      "message": "There\u0027s an existing group unfortunately called \u0027auth-trusted-services\u0027 with a list of services that can subscribe to AuthDB notifications. It is NOT actually trusted enough to impersonate LUCI projects. (There are many \"random\" non-LUCI services there we don\u0027t really fully trust since we don\u0027t manage them).\n\nauth-luci-services will contain ONLY services that are part of single LUCI deployment and which want to make outbound calls with X-Luci-Project headers. For prod it initially will contain:\n  * luci-scheduler@\n  * luci-milo@\n  * cr-buildbucket@\n  * commit queue\n\nMore will be added as needed.\n\nAnother naming option is to reuse https://chrome-infra-auth.appspot.com/auth/groups/auth-project-actors, but trim it to contain only very few services.\n\nWdyt?",
